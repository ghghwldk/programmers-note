[Reason for wrong answer]
I didn't check the empty string for the splitted strings.

The problem provides me the contraints to follow.
I have to consider the consecutive space in the string.

Consecutive space makes the empty strings after splitting string.

[Ability problem]
It is not the mistake. It is from my own scarce ability.
To prevent the same issue.
I have to recognize the wrong answer is from my scarce ability.

[strategy for the future]
Not to make the problem from not-following the constraints.

I've to read over the constraints and the conditions from the problem.

I've to do this before submitting my answer.
It is the optimal time to check
